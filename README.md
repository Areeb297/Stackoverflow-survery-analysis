## Stackoverflow-survery-analysis

- This project involves data preprocessing and cleaning steps of a survey taken by Stackoverflow users where the objective is to use the data exploration and insight
steps to be able to create an appropriate machine learning model which can predict the the number of years a user has experienced working in the IT or programming domain.

- We take a classification approach where the number of years experience is split into three groups: Grad/Junior, Mid-Senior, Experienced Professional
- This approach however, did not result in high accuracy where 55% f1 scores were obtained for each category and hence more work needs to be done on the feature engineering or ML part where perhaps a regression approach would be best
